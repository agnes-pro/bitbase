Here’s a revised and more structured version of the README to make it look more professional:

# **BitBase: A Bitcoin Layer 2 Dashboard on Stacks**

**BitBase** is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to manage their Bitcoin-based tokens using the Stacks blockchain, providing a sleek dashboard for viewing balances, transferring tokens, and tracking transaction history. Built with Clarity smart contracts and a React-based frontend, BitBase leverages Bitcoin's security while providing flexible features on a Layer 2 solution.

---

## **Features**

- **View Wallet Balance**: Display wallet balances securely using Stacks API.
- **Token Transfers**: Execute secure token transfers between wallets via Clarity smart contracts.
- **Transaction History**: View recent transaction history and blockchain interactions.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Smart Contract**: [Clarity](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/clarity) for contract logic and token management.
- **Frontend**: [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Blockchain Integration**: [Stacks.js](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js) for interaction between the frontend and the Stacks blockchain.
- **Testing**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for automated testing of Clarity contracts.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **Stacks CLI** for deploying and interacting with Clarity contracts.

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agnes-pro/bitbase.git
   cd bitbase
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Usage**

#### 1. **Smart Contract Deployment**:

Deploy the Clarity smart contract to the Stacks blockchain:

```bash
stacks deploy contract clarity/token.clar
```

#### 2. **Run the Frontend Locally**:

Start the React-based frontend for interacting with the contract:

```bash
npm start
```

You can now access the dashboard locally at `http://localhost:3000` to view balances, send tokens, and interact with transactions.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized as follows:

```plaintext
bitbase/
├── clarity/               # Clarity smart contract code
│   └── token.clar         # Smart contract handling token transfers
├── frontend/              # Frontend code
│   ├── src/               # React components and logic
│   └── public/            # Static assets
├── tests/                 # Unit tests for the smart contract
├── README.md              # Documentation
└── package.json           # Project metadata and dependencies
```

---

## **Development Workflow**

### **Branching Strategy**

Follow a feature-based branching strategy for development:

- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `feature/*`: Development branches for specific features (e.g., `feature/smart-contract`, `feature/frontend-ui`).

### **Commit Messages**

Write descriptive commit messages. Example format:

- `feat: added token transfer functionality`
- `fix: corrected balance display issue`

### **Pull Requests**

Ensure each pull request (PR) includes:

- A detailed description of the changes.
- The issue or feature it addresses.
- Screenshots (if applicable) and testing notes.

---

## **Testing**

Automated tests are critical for ensuring contract reliability. To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests will cover:

- **Clarity Contract**: Unit tests for token transfer, wallet interactions, and error handling.
- **Frontend**: Integration tests for user actions (e.g., viewing balances, transferring tokens).

---

## **Security**

Security is a top priority. The smart contract includes:

- **Transfer Validations**: Prevent unauthorized token transfers.
- **Revert on Failures**: Safeguard transactions to ensure state consistency.

During development, ensure your keys and sensitive information are not exposed. Use `.env` files for environment-specific settings and avoid committing them.

---

## **Contribution Guidelines**

We welcome contributions! Follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
3. Implement your changes.
4. Submit a detailed pull request, explaining your contribution.

Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes all tests before submitting.
